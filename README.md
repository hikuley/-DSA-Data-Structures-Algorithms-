# DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

This project contains Java implementations of common data structures and algorithms for learning and practice purposes.

## Features

- Linked lists (singly linked list with insert, append, and prepend methods)
- Insertions at specific positions with bounds checking
- Object-oriented design using Node class

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-java.git
   cd dsa-java
   ```

2. Build and run using your preferred IDE or with `javac`:
   ```
   javac -d out src/org/dsa/*.java
   java -cp out org.dsa.Main
   ```

## Structure

- `Main.java`: Entry point for running demonstrations
- `Node.java`: Node class for linked list
- `LinkedList.java`: Implementation of linked list logic
